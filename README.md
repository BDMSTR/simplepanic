This is a panic button script for ESX

###
-------
###
Thanks to Vespura for the base script: https://forum.fivem.net/t/emergency-location-message/55844

I modified it to work with ESX aswell as only cops can see and use the command

###
-------
###
Use /13 to use the panic button
###
Will display street name and cross if there is one
###
Can only be used and seen by cops
